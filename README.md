# psyche-orbit-dataviewer
An interactive website with 3D models that visualized the types of data that will be gained from different orbital phases during the Psyche mission. 
## Explanations

In January 2027, the Psyche Spacecraft will begin orbiting the asteroid, gathering data
on it’s surface, composition, and interior structure. This is a visiulization of the data we
hope to gain accross four different phases of orbits.

The spacecraft will be constantly gathering data, but because of distance,
stability, and lighting, certain kinds of data will be prioritized for particular
groups of orbits. Click on each one to learn more!

## Orbit Descriptions
### Orbit A
For the first part of our exploration, we will be focused on measuring the 
gravity and magnetic fields using radio and the magnetometer. This is 
essential to allow us to proceed closer to the asteroid for the following orbits.

### Orbit B
This period will provide the best lighting to create high resolution images and maps of the surface. The other instruments will continue gathering data but the main focus will be on using the Imager.

### Orbit C
This set of orbits continue to attain images where feasible, but will focus on completing the gravity and magnetic field science objectives.

### Orbit D
Finally, we will work on obtaining a complete analysis of the elemental composition so we can gain a better understanding of the asteroid’s composition and formation.  The equatorial orbit is more stable.
