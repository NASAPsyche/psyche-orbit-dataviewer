        <h2>Psyche Orbital Data</h2>
        <p>
            In January 2026, the Psyche Spacecraft will begin its orbit
            around the asteroid, gathering data about the asteroid's surface, composition, 
            and interior structure. This is a visiulization of the data we 
            hope to gain accross four different phases of orbits.

        <h2>Orbit Phases</h2>

        <p>
            The spacecraft will be constantly gathering data, but because of
            distance, stability, and lighting certain kinds of data will be
            prioritized during specific orbits. Click on each one
            to learn more! Click and drag to rotate around the model, hold
            shift to pan.

            For the first part of our exploration, we will be focused on
            measuring the gravity and magnetic fields using x-band radio
            telecommunications system and the magnetometer. This is
            essential to allow us to proceed closer to
            the asteroid for the following orbits, as well as to make a
            topographic map of the asteroid.

        <p id="pB">
            This orbit will provide the best lighting to create high
            resolution images and maps of the surface. The other instruments
            will continue gathering data, but the main focus will be on using
            the multispectral imager.

        <p id="pC">
            The third orbit continues to obtain images when feasible, but
            will focus on completing the gravity and magnetic field science
            objectives, revealing the asteroid's structure.

        <p id="pD">
            Finally, we will work on obtaining a complete analysis of the
            elemental composition so we can gain a better understanding of
            the asteroidâ€™s history and formation which may have involved a
            hypothesized impact as shown. Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

        <p id="pF">
            It is hypothesized that, the impact could have resulted in many small collections
            of material. One of these blobs (such as the one circled in blue)
            may have formed into the asteroid we see today!

            Special thanks to Josh Meister and Peter Rubin for their incredible 
            models, as well as Robert Edward Melikyan, a graduate student from the
            University of Arizona, for speaking to us and teaching Pysche Inspired
            about computer modeling and simulations.
