        <h2>Psyche Orbital Data</h2>
        <p>
            In January 2027, the Psyche Spacecraft will begin orbiting the
            asteroid, gathering data on it’s surface, composition, and
            interior structure. This is a visiulization of the data we
            hope to gain accross four different phases of orbits.  
        </p>

        <h2>Orbit Phases</h2>

        <p>
            The spacecraft will be constantly gathering data, but because of
            distance, stability, and lighting, certain kinds of data will be
            prioritized for particular groups of orbits. Click on each one
            to learn more! Click and drag to rotate around the model, hold
            shift to pan.

        <p id="pA">
            For the first part of our exploration, we will be focused on
            measuring the gravity and magnetic fields using radio and the
            magnetometer. This is essential to allow us to proceed closer to
            the asteroid for the following orbits as well as to make a
            topographic map of the asteroid.

            This period will provide the best lighting to create high
            resolution images and maps of the surface. The other instruments
            will continue gathering data but the main focus will be on using
            the Imager.

            This set of orbits continue to attain images where feasible, but
            will focus on completing the gravity and magnetic field science
            objectives, revealing the asteroid's structure.

        <p id="pD">
            Finally, we will work on obtaining a complete analysis of the
            elemental composition so we can gain a better understanding of
            the asteroid’s history and formation which likely involved a massive
            impact like the one shown. Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

        <button id="bF" type="button">See the final result</button>
        <p id="pF">
            Ultimately, the impact could have resulted in many small collections
            of material. One of these blobs (such as the one circled in blue)
            may have formed into the asteroid we see today!

            models!
